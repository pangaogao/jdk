/**
 * Map将会提供一个基于keys的全排序
 * map排序的比较器是在创建的时候，默认依据keys的自然排序，顺序反映在排序map的entrySet、keySet、values
 *
 *
 *
 * 排序map的有序性必须是一致性equals，关于一致性equals可参考Comparable或者Comparator接口，这是因为排序map的定义是基于equals操作的
 * 所有排序map的键比较是使用compareTo或compare方法
 *
 * 下面注意下TODO：
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <em>consistent with equals</em> if
 * the sorted map is to correctly implement the {@code Map} interface.  (See
 * the {@code Comparable} interface or {@code Comparator} interface for a
 * precise definition of <em>consistent with equals</em>.)  This is so because
 * the {@code Map} interface is defined in terms of the {@code equals}
 * operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 * {@code compareTo} (or {@code compare}) method, so two keys that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 * equal.  The behavior of a tree map <em>is</em> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the {@code Map} interface.
 *
 * 所有的排序map实现应该提供四种标准的构造方法，但不是强制的，因为接口不能指定构造方法
 * 标准的构造方法如下：
 * 无参构造方法、比较器参数构造方法、普通map参数构造方法（依据key的自然排序）、排序map的构造方法
 *
 * 说明：有几个方法返回限制key范围的子map，比如半开，也就是说包含低值不包含高值，即前闭后开
 * 有一个简单的技巧：如下：
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an <em>open range</em>
 * (which contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a
 * view containing all of the key-value mappings in {@code m} whose keys
 * are between {@code low} and {@code high}, exclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedMap&lt;String, V&gt; sub = m.subMap(low+"\0", high);</pre>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by this map
 * @param <V> the type of mapped values
